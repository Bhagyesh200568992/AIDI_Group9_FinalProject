The goal of this project is to perform sentiment analysis on financial text data to determine if the sentiment is positive or negative.
We use a pre-trained BERT model, fine-tuned on our dataset, to classify the text into two categories: positive and negative.

We used the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, which is a powerful transformer-based model designed for natural language understanding tasks.
The BERT tokenizer was used to tokenize the text data, ensuring that the text is formatted correctly for input into the BERT model.
